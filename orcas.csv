We were relaxing in the cockpit with a podcast playing quite loudly on a portable speaker. It was pitch black as the moon had not yet risen. A lone adult orca (to our knowledge) approached our yacht (Beneteau Oceanis 411) and surfaced about half a metre from our stern. We were only alerted to it's presence when it's blowhole spouted\ roughly 0.5 metres off the left side of our stern\ right next to our navigation light. It was so close to us that the water from its blowhole hit our chart plotter. We stood up to inspect and saw 1 very large (adult) Orca. We scrambled to grab our foghorn\ and 2 x firecrackers that had been passed on to us by fellow sailors. We put on our lifejackets and deployed 1 firecracker into the water\ around 1-2 minutes later. We then quickly turned our engine on and motor sailed ahead at full speed\ bracing for impact. Luckily\ the boat was not hit at all. We motored for around 1 hour before deciding that the coast was clear. There may have been more orcas\ but we could not see because it was too dark.,I would describe the behaviour of the Orca during this interaction as placid and curious. I think that it was possibly drawn to us because of our stern light\ and perhaps the sound of the autopilot and the loud voices from the podcast being broadcast through our speaker. It did not display any aggressive behaviour\ and the fact that it surfaced so close to our stern light indicates to me that it was just curiously checking us out. Given that we were taken completely by surprise\ it took us a good few minutes to deploy our deterrent tactics. It would have been only a few metres away from our rudder\ and could have easily attacked us if it wanted to.,undefined,waning\81% illuminated,Within 3 days of spring tide,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We were on autohelm for the first hit and then I was hand steering. The second interaction only lasted a few minutes but was more violent. During the first encounter we tried pumping out the black water tank that had been prefilled with a bleach solution. This was not effective and if anything provoked some of the hits.

Mon équipier de quart nous a immédiatement alerté\ il a coupé le pilote et pris la barre. Il a subit entre 6 et 7 coups sur le safran. J'ai indiqué notre position immédiatement au MRCC Tarifa. Nous avons coupé le moteur. Nous avions préparé un "Pinger" (répulsif que les pécheurs installent sur leur filet pour éviter aux cétacés de se prendre dans leur filets\ qui émettent des ondes basse-fréquence). Le temps de le mettre à l'eau\ et sans pouvoir le confirmer\ les orques sont partis dans le même moment. Notre bateau est un bateau de 65 pieds de régate\ tout en carbon\ donc très raide\ avec des safrans en carbon également\ ce qui a pu contribuer à leur désintéressement. Une fois les orques repartis\ nous avons plongé la camera pour repérer d'éventuels impacts ou avaries\ et heureusement rien n'a été a signalé. Dans l'heure qui a suivi\ même après avoir tenu informé le MRCC Tarifa\ une vedette des secours espagnols en provenance de Cadiz est venue à notre rencontre./// In the early morning\ when we had crossed Gibraltar at the end of the night and with wind\ we were going up towards Faro by motor sailing in moderate seas\ 2 medium-sized killer whales arrived by our starboard bow\ and they immediately attacked the rudders (especially the starboard rudder\ we were on port tack). My crewmate alerted us immediately\ he switched off the autopilot and took the helm. we suffered between 6 and 7 hits on the rudder. I reported our position immediately to MRCC Tarifa. We shut down the engine. We had prepared a "Pinger" (repellent that fishermen install on their net to prevent cetaceans from getting caught in their nets\ which emit low-frequency waves). It took time to put it in the water\ and without being able to confirm it\ the killer whales left at the same time. Our boat is a 65-foot racing boat\ all in carbon\ so very stiff\ with carbon rudders as well\ which may have contributed to their lack of interest. Once the killer whales left\ we lowered the camera to identify any impacts or damage\ and fortunately nothing was reported. In the following hour\ even after keeping the MRCC Tarifa informed\ a Spanish rescue boat from Cadiz came to meet us.,Les orques sont arrivés rapidement\ et ont tout de suite attaqué les safrans à plusieurs reprises.

We were under motor at roughly 7 knots when there was a wobble of the boat and the port helm was unresponsive i then saw a chunk of rudder float up at the transom and wondered if we had got a semi submerged container. At this point we saw the 3 attacking whales. We stopped and shut the engines off but they continued to attack the rudders - we called Tarifa Traffic and reported the attack to them. Due to traffic we had to try and move when they moved away from the boat after around 30 minutes of continued attacks on the rudder so I tried to motor but they had damaged the rudder so badly on port side it was facing backwards and I could not steer. Luckily they came back when we tried to move and again attacked undoing the 180 spin they had previously caused which was a help as I was not strong enough to bend this back. They continued to harass us for a further 30 minutes and then backed off again although we could still hear them breathing a short distance off. I turned on the under water lights we have to assess the damage and then with shipping approaching took the decision to make a run for it. In doing this I was violently shaking the wheel port and starboard so that they weee unable to put those noses on the ragged rudders to break more of the rudders off. They were immediately on us when we moved again but being unable to push the rudders due to the erratic movement they soon bored of harassing us and although they followed for a further few minutes they left us alone.,Predatory and not playful. They were aggressively diving off the aft quarter of the boat into a deep dive and then swimming straight for the rudders. The aggressive breathing next to the boat and what I would call bullying tactics were not indicative of ‘play’. When in the lazerette attempting to undo the massive damage they had caused I could hear them communicating with each other a lot. There were three individuals\ a large male\ slightly smaller male and the third individual who did not attack as much had some grey on its upper torso.,undefined,waning\88% illuminated,Within 3 days of spring tide,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That was the start. I directly realised there are no sandbanks in the bay of Biscay and we had 150 meters of water below so then I thought we hit some fishing equipment. In a few seconds I was in the cockpit and my crew said there were orca's. A few meters from the boat next to the cockpit I saw on both sides (port and starboard) 2-3 orca's. Further away from the boat a few more. They were swimming along\ grey\ 3\5 to 4 meters long and definitly not the dolphins which we see daily around the boat. I swear they looked into the cockpit as we looked each other in the eye for a moment. I realised that a normal orca is 8 meters long\ black on top and with a white belly so this group were juveniles testing their hunting skills. We fully rolled in the genoa but because of the broad reach and the waves we sailed on bare poles still 2\5 - 3 knots. We played a dead bird by doing nothing and after a number of attacks on the rudder they disappeared. My crew had noticed that at the first attack\ what I experienced as a sandbank\ the steeringwheel was violently rotated both directions right through the autopilot.,See above for full story. The sandbank look-a-like experiences I could only explain as an attack by 3 orca swimming in a queue (behind each other) and hitting the hull one by one.

We looked behind us and sure enough we could see several black and white huge shapes rolling under the stern. Jolting the boat. No easy fest at 22tones! We hadn't read any advice of what to do so we just put both engines in both hulls full ahead and watched the show with mixed joy and horror\ both engine rooms open to see if any damage occurred. Luckily nothing was damaged and they tired themselves out. They swam away abruptly and a little way off into we could see all the fins lined up in a row as they swam away in formation.

After another minute a third hit to the rudder arrived and they surfaced. It was a pack of 3-4 killer whales. We turned on engine with the hope to dissuade them from the rudder\ but it was already too late\ the 4th hit arrived and the rudder was blocked in an extreme position and not usable anymore. We dropped sails and called for a tow. While calling I turned off the depth meter which was beeping in alarm because the animals were swimming at 40cm from the keel.

I had heard an exhale behind me and then the first hit against the rudder followed. Since I was traveling single-handed\ I could no longer salvage the sails. I turned off the autopilot and continued to steer myself. Since I was now in front of the traffic separation scheme\ I increased the engine speed and tried to avoid the animals with the wind. I drove snake lines and when the animals were next to me and dived under the hull I drove to the opposite side. This has worked several times. There were three animals. A large one with a length of approx. 8-9m and two smaller ones with a length of approx. 6m. The smaller ones pushed against the rudder several times. Twice I was turned 180 degrees by the big animal at full speed of 8-9 knots. The interaction lasted 25 minutes. It didn't feel like an attack\ it was more like training. I didn't notice the damage to the rudder at first because I was able to continue sailing normally. However\ the ship had difficulties keeping upwind. I continued to sail to La Linea under motor sails. I only saw the damage to the rudder in port.

The Ruder Quadrant sheered of on the second hard impact so we could not no longer manoeuvre the boat. The very strong full rudder skeg must have broken after 3-5 minutes of repeated impacting\ causing the rudder shaft bearing to break off this causing a big leak. We left the engine running in idle. Maday call was send and handled by Tarifa traffic. We then managed to reduce the leak with a bedsheet and rope and the 2 large electric pumps kept the water in the boat down. We cancelled Mayday call after 10 minutes. The Orcas suddenly left after around 15 minutes. Under engine and with the Hydrovane windvane steering we made it into Tangier where the boat was lifted out.,The first two impacts came without warning and were the most severe. We initially only saw two large Orcas. There was a clear pattern of them swimming up to the boat\ noisily blowing out air 5-10 meters from the boat and them diving under hitting the boat in the rudder section. After 3-5 minutes many more Orcas of different sizes turned up\ probably 6-10. The impacts then felt more playful and they then also started to push the boat along.

It felt as if we had hit a rock. We immediately turned off the engine and autopilot. The orca hit us 3 or 4 times as we threw sand and banged with a hammer on a Steel Rod which we had hanging in the water. It went away but after 5 minites it returned to bang on the rudder again\ maybe 3 times. We banged wildly with the hammer on the Steel Rod and after a few minutes it disappeared. We now had no steering and no wind\ the boat was not moving much. Both the main rudder and hyrovane emergency rudder were damaged and not working. Inside the boat the steel metal unit for the cable was broken in 3 parts\the fiberglass around the rudder was cracked and there was a water leak underneath the rudder attachment somewhere. The bilde pump alarm was being activated every 10 minutes. We tried many times to contact the coast guard by vhf but got no answer. We sent a VHF message to all ships in the area\ about our position and situation. No answer. We then sent a Pan Pan message\ no answer. We phoned Sines marina\ they could not help us much\ but we managed to phone the police in Sines. We then got a phone call from Lisbon rescue team asking if we fine or in danger. We told them we had a water leak but were managing to keep it under control when we manually pumped the bilge every 10 minutes. They would then send a rescue crew. The rescue team arrived by rib at 1.30 PM and towed us to the harbour of Beleeira\ after 4 hrs. We were then attached to a mooring. ( we had to manually pump the bilge every 5 minutes while being towed) Now on mooring we tried to get a tug boat to bring us to Lagos so we could get lifted on land. No one was available... Phoned a tow company who recommended us to get a diver in Beleeria to try and seal the leak. We had to pump every 10 minutes now. Diver came and saw a 1 meter crack on the hull where the rudder was attached to the hull. He tried to seal it with silicone but it did not hold so he tried again with 2 component epoxy. He could not reach the crack nearest the rudder but less water was leaking now. So during the whole night the bilge alarm went off every 20 minutes and we had to manually empty the bilge then in order to avoid overflooding. Already the floors in the rear cabin and a corridor floor were been flooded. At 8AM the next morning we were exhausted and managed to get a tow boat from Beleeira ( none were available in Lagos) to bring us to Lagos. It took 7 hrs to get towed by a rib boat with 225 hrp. We had contacted Lagos marina and they were waiting for us. As soon as we arrived we were lifted up. We paid the diver and towing crew and they would send us a report and invoice.We slept while on slings and today\ December 2\ we are placed on land in the Lagos marina boatyard. On arrival we made contact with the police and registered with the harbour master today. We contacted our insurrance company right after the attach and will send them a copy of this report. The reporter added the following comments at a later date when contacted by the Cruising Association: "We used the steel emergency shaft and banged on it with a heavy steel hammer. We had beforehand welded on a steel extension. It is therefore 132cm long and has a 90 degree attachment 36cm long. It is hollow.

The thug immediately came around and hit the same port rudder a second time - about 30 servings after the initial attack. We were just understanding what had happened from the first hit when the second hit occurred. We immediately initiated an Orca protocol we had rehearsed: Crew 1 - Disengage autopilot - go grab 3x4 foot piece of white fiber board\ with 30 for line attached\ to drag behind boat ( This never got deployed). Crew 2 - Stop engine. Pour four 1.5 litter bottles of urine over transom. (Urine had ZERO effect). Place boathook in water\ bang on it with metal lbilge pump handle (ZERO effect - except I was able to "poke" the thug with the boat hook. This did nothing\ the thug merely pushed it away). Crew 3. Open holding tanks - about 15 gallons on starboard and 3 gallons on port. (ZERO effect\ the thug swam right through it\ undeterred). Grab Ditch bags. Crew 4. Lower sails (already down) spot for orcas\ prepare radio call (no need) . The damaged rudder caused the boat to move in a circle.

Ma première préoccupation a été de relever le safran du régulateur d'allure qui avait été percuté par les orques. La barre était reliée au régulateur donc bloquée par rapport au safran. Je n'ai pas pensé à la libérer tout de suite\ c'est sans doute pourquoi la poussée des orques sur le safran a détérioré la jonction barre et tube de jaumière.

The boat was turning on itself. My first concern was to raise the rudder of the wind vane which had been hit by the killer whales. The helm was connected to the regulator and therefore locked in relation to the rudder. I didn't think of freeing it right away\ which is probably why the killer whales pushing on the rudder damaged the junction between the bar and the rudder tube. I ended up thinking about it. Another 2 or 3 push of the killer whales then they left for Cape Espichel. Interaction of about 5 minutes. I joined Sesimbra under engine with the helm at 45° from its usual position. Everything went very quickly and I did nothing but try to save my regulator.,Les m'ont semblé jouer à la toupie avec mon bateau sans agressivité.

We followed the official guidance\ switching off all systems and engines and calling Tarifa Traffic to let them know what was happening. We then waited for the orcas to get bored and depart. The attack lasted approximately an hour\ during which time we took no action whatsoever other than to try to capture some of it on video. Unfortunately they completely disabled the steering system of the boat. Both rudders dropped and much of the internal steering mechanism was bent or broken. In the aftermath\ unable to make way under our own steam and drifting fast towards the shipping lanes\ we called for assistance and awaited the coast guard who towed us in to Tarifa.,The orcas we clearly coordinated in their actions - at times taking it in turns (almost queuing up) to bump the boat\ and at others lining up alongside each other and pushing us along. I have a catamaran which has sail drives astern of the rudders. Notwithstanding the fact that the engines were off and the props stationary\ the orcas were clearly being very careful to avoid the sail drives in trying to get to the rudders. There was no question that the rudders were their targets. On a couple of occasions they almost got the dinghy (hanging on davits) with tail slaps\ but I didn't get the impression that they were specifically trying to get it. I will upload a compilation of video clips I shot during the encounter\ which shows some of what happened. What the video does not adequately represent though is the sheer force with which they were hitting the boat. Their behaviour was not playful - they were clearly intent on doing damage.

On our boat the propeller is located very close to the rudder. Therefore we started the engine and went by motor (motorsailing) when we saw the 3-4 orcas coming. Just before we got the engine and propeller running - we heard a ”bang” from the rudder when it got hit by an orca. After a few seconds a second hit on the rudder came. At this point the captain onboard started to pour fine-grained sand (from beach) on the top of our rudder. Now We had both the propeller running and sand to disturb the orcas with. We then saw two orcas leaving (they were 3-4 when they came) and no more interaction/hit was made after this. We kept an eye over the sea but couldn’t see them anymore. Total time we had them around us was maybe 2 minutes. No damage that we know about (will take the boat up on the hard tomorrow). All the time we had the autopilot connected\ no damage to that either. For us it seems the orcas lost interest very quickly. It might have been because of; 1. The rudder was huge and made of stainless steel 2. Our big propeller was running very close to the rudder (30 cm) 3. We poured sand over our rudder and maybe the orcas didn’t like this. It seemed they stayed away when we did this (we did not throw sand on them\ we just poured sand on our rudder and let the sand drop into the sea. We do not want to harm them ). We can not for sure say why they so quick lost the interest\ But we believe it could have been 1 or 2 or maybe all three reasons as we described above.

After passing Cabo Espichel we turned to port aiming to skirt along the edge of the deep water in the Canhao de Setabul (761 Meter) and then turn to Starboard as the water shallowed. Approximately 1100 we heard a report of an Orca attacking a 10 meter yacht somewhere ahead. We did not get the exact position but estimated it to be in the middle of the deep water channel. The yacht reported the Orca left them after 15 minutes\ they had sustained damage to their rudder but could still steer to a limited degree and were making their way to Sines for inspection and repair. Another yacht contacted them and offered to shadow them. 1230: In 120 meters depth a large Orca surfaced behind us. I turned 90 degrees to port heading directly for the shallow water and maintained speed\ 6.7 Kts under engine alone. The Orca then surfaced very close to our Port aft and came along side its estimated length was 5-6 meters. I radioed an all stations position report saying we had a large Orca alongside with no hull contact at this time. At 1205 the Orca made first contact with the hull on the aft port side. I updated the all station radio report with the information that the Orca was now making contact with us. For the next 15 minutes the Orca alternately brushed up against our Port and starboard sides always at the back. We all felt the stern being lifted as it passed under the hull. The contact could be felt as shoves more than blows and the lifting of the hull was only approx. 0.5 meters maximum but then our yacht does weigh 18 Tonnes so that is a lot of weight to shove around. I kept the rudder centralised and didn’t feel any significant impact although with hydraulic steering the wheel does not transmit much if any feedback at the best of times. After approximately 15 minutes the Orca was seen swimming away to the North West. My impression was that we were being warned off or shepherded away from the deeper water. Perhaps there was a young orca nearby? That is pure conjecture as we saw no other Orcas. We continued in towards the beach and hugged the coast keeping below 50 meters for the rest of the trip and had no other sightings.

On social media the skipper reported that he had turned on the engine and thought about reversing but that this agitated the orcas and they slapped their tails so he played dead instead. This comment may refer to the first interaction 6 hours earlier as the video of this second interaction show the yacht and crew "playing dead"\ possibly after the experience of agitating the orcas earlier? The crew were able to sail back to port although repairs are required.,The orcas were seen on video to be calm\ with the yacht stationary in light wind and calm sea.

Then we simply waited without making any noise inside or outside\ did not show ourselves to the Orcas and waited until they left. They rammed the rudder and occasionally the centerboard but mostly the rudder. The hydraulic system of the autopilot was damaged. We could continue after waiting 30 min after they left.

The first lasting approximately an hour\ the second approximately the same\ the last approximately 15 minutes. It then took approximately 4 hours to motor sail to shore with the main only (in case the orcas returned) and upwind. Without warning they attacked the rudder (initially felt like hitting drift wood or such like). The plan in case of an interaction was to put the engine in reverse and drop a spinnaker pole into the water and hit it with a hammer. The engine was started within a minute of the first hit. It had no noticeable effect but is only a small (12hp 2 stroke) engine and we made minimal headway\ although that is largely due to the rudder being hard over. We could not reverse in a straight line. The orcas still managed to get to the rudder (possibly from the inside of the circular arc we made). I suppose with a more powerful engine going astern would make it more difficult for them to get purchase in the rudder. The whole attack was focused on the rudder. The wind vane trim tab was not touched and it was in fine working order following the attacks (this being only .5m from the aft edge of the rudder)\ the propeller was also unharmed although it was used to deter them by increasing revs in gear (and noise\ it’s a 2-stroke engine). At one point the engine on full whack was stopped in an instant with a thud as one orca must have butted it. The propeller sits only inches from the rudder\ but they didn’t try to damage that\ nor the propeller shaft log housing\ nor the keel. Preventative measures: Engine in astern. Engine ahead. Engine revved in neutral. Engine revved up on the approach of an orca. Spinnaker pole in the water and hit with a club hammer (the hull to a few whacks in the palaver). The rudder stock itself hit with a club hammer (as it protrudes into the water directly where they were). Complete Silence and tried to ignore them. I also shouted …. off a few times\ if this counts for attempting to communicate\ I don’t know. We considered throwing in flares\ but with the sea state they would of drifted away very quickly. We were also very conscious of turning their focused aggression into a more broad attack. No action plan had any noticeable positive or negative affect. As mentioned\ they seemed focused on their aim. Going silent and doing nothing seemed to give them free reign to destroy\ but that may have only seemed the case\ as no attention was focused elsewhere. Doing nothing also felt awful\ the feeling that your vessel is being destroyed\ and may founder\ and you’re doing nothing…. The fact that the attack lasted 3 hours is testament to a well built rudder\ but is that a good of bad thing? If it were foam filled the attack would last 10 minutes and there would be less damage elsewhere. Following the attack (and during): We made an all ships call to notify all in the vicinity initially. When we thought we had lost steerage we made a security call. We had no response on the VHF. We aimed for shore as much as we could. Luckily the shore was upwind. Therefore\ with the main trimmed in\ the vessel naturally went tack to tack that very slowly took us toward the shore. We steered with a stillson wrench (see below) back to shore\ facing aft to continually check on returning fish! The aim was to get to shallow water before assessing damage. We continually checked the bilge to check if she was taking on water. Damage: The rudder chain snapped at the barrel tensioner (8mm mild steel thread sheared). The rudder stops made of bronze were obliterated. The port side one was removed and the starboard one is just hanging on. The bronze top collar (which the stops were part of) is very dented. There is some cracking to the hull around the rudder stock aperture but I do not yet know the extent of this damage. The lower and upper collar housings heavily constructed of fibreglass appear to be damage free. The rudder blade is destroyed. The stock appears ok and still plumb. The lower stainless tang was in place following the attack but had fallen off by the time of haul out later the same day. The bulkhead tabbing\ laminate\ and other reinforcing members are yet to be inspected. The damage is approximately going to take 3 weeks (that’s the yard working on the rudder\ and me surveying\ repairing and reinforcing hull cracks and steering gear). Note: Emergency tiller was fitted for steerage\ but as the orcas came back 3 times\ it presents a real danger to those at the helm\ as the knock of an orca would easily cause the tiller to break a rib or a wrist. We controlled the stock with a large stillson (monkey wrench if you like) which allowed some steerage and was easy to remove in the event of another encounter.,We counted 4 orcas\ but there has been reports of 6 in the region\ and there were signs of orcas beneath much before the surfaced ones would of had time to go down\ so\ we saw 4 (what we presume to be two males\ a female and a calf)\ but there may have been 1-2 more. They continually rammed\ butted and bit the rudder\ turning it from lock to lock with intense power and seeming ease. There was the sense that they had full commitment to destroying the rudder\ regardless of our action plan. This was one of the longest attacks I’ve heard of and it felt extremely aggressive. Much our our attempts to deter them seemed to encourage more aggression\ doing close circles of us\ splashing us with their flutes and spraying us from their blow holes. Interestingly\ they constantly eyed us. They never came up facing us or facing away; they came up side on\ and slowed as their eyes surfaced watching us for a second or two. It certainly felt as if they were teaching the calf because following a hefty attack\ what felt like a light nibble followed. The power was incredible and the whole boat would shake and spin depending on whether they rammed us from behind or the side.,before dawn,waxing\5% illuminated\within 3 days of new,Within 3 days of spring tide,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Se encontraban a bordo 5 personas adultas incluido el patrón. A las 16:15 horas\ a unas dos millas al nordeste de las Islas Sisargas hemos sufrido un ataque de orcas. Comenzó con el avistamiento de un ejemplar de unos dos o tres metros\ que muy pronto empezó a golpear el casco del barco. Realizamos una primera llamada por radio a Salvamento Marítimo\ exponiendo la situación e indicando que\ de momento\ no necesitábamos asistencia. Esta orca solitaria pareció perder interés en nosotros e intentamos abrir velas para apartarnos de ella. En seguida volvió a la carga y esta vez acompañada de otros dos ejemplares\ una de tamaño similar\ unos 3 metros\ con una cria más pequeña. Llamamos a Salvamento de nuevo y nos comunicaron que enviaban asistencia inmediata desde La Coruña. Nos encontrábamos en ese momento a unas 20 millas de dicho puerto. Nos tocaba esperar una hora y media. Las orcas empezaron a dar vueltas al barco y a golpear la pala del timón. A continuación aparecieron otros dos ejemplares. Uno de ellos más grande que los demás\ de unos 7/8 metros. (Intento ser objetivo con los tamaños. En esa situación parecían medir mucho mas) que también golpeaban y mordían el timón. La grande era capaz de voltear el barco como si de una peonza se tratase. Empezaron a salir a la superficie trozos de espuma y fibra de lo que suponíamos era parte del timón. A bordo la tripulación\ con chalecos y bolsa de emergencia preparada\ esperábamos con mucha impaciencia la llegada de la salvamar. Nuestra mayor preocupación era que en uno de los golpes abrieran una vía de agua. En todo momento todos los tripulantes estuvieron serenos y tranquilos\ haciendo caso a las indicaciones del patrón y con un comportamiento ejemplar\ dada la situación y la poca experiencia en el mar de alguno de ellos. Tras una hora recibiendo los ataques\ un trozo grande del timón\ de aproximadamente 60 cms.\ salió a la superficie. Una de las orcas se puso a olisquear lo y a “jugar” con el unos minutos para sumergirse a continuación. Pensamos que ahí terminaba todo\ que al romper por fin el timón habían conseguido su objetivo y se marcharían. Sin embargo continuaron con el mismo comportamiento. Por fin apareció la salvamar Betelgeuse. Dieron un par de pasadas con un par de acelerones y las orcas desaparecieron. Nos preguntan si estamos todos bien\ a lo que contesto afirmativamente\ y que si teníamos gobierno o necesitábamos remolque. Arranco máquina y el barco parece responder al timón por lo que ponemos rumbo a La Coruña acompañados por la Salvamar que se ofrece a escoltarnos. Pasados unos minutos y con la Salvamar a unos 200 metros de nosotros dos orcas aparecen por nuestra popa y nos golpean de nuevo. La Salvamar se acerca inmediatamente y vuelven a desaparecer. El patrón de la misma se sorprende de la intensidad de el golpe\ del que son testigos. Sin mas sobresaltos y escoltados muy de cerca por la Salvamar llegamos al Real Club Náutico de La Coruña\ donde amarramos el mismo día 14 a las 19:15.” Google Translation: Statement of owner made by e-mail: "On August 14\ 2022 we sailed sailing\ coming from Finisterre in demand of La Coruña. There were 5 adults on board including the skipper. At 4:15 p.m.\ about two miles northeast of the Sisargas Islands\ we suffered an attack by killer whales. It began with the sighting of a specimen of about two or three meters\ which very soon began to hit the hull of the ship. We made a first radio call to Salvamento Marítimo\ exposing the situation and indicating that\ at the moment\ we did not need assistance. This lonely orca seemed to lose interest in us and we tried to set sails to get away from it. She then returned to the load and this time accompanied by two other specimens\ one of similar size\ about 3 meters\ with a smaller calf. We called Salvamento again and they told us that they were sending immediate assistance from La Coruña. We were at that time about 20 miles from that port. We had to wait an hour and a half. The orcas began to circle the ship and hit the rudder lade. Two other specimens followed. One of them larger than the others\ about 7/8 meters. (I try to be objective with sizes. In that situation they seemed to measure much more) who also hit and bit the rudder. The big one was able to turn the ship round like a spinning top. Pieces of foam and fiber began to surface from what we assumed was part of the rudder. On board the crew\ with vests and emergency bag prepared\ we waited very impatiently for the arrival of the salvamar. Our biggest concern was that in one of the blows they would open a waterway. At all times all the crew were serene and calm\ heeding the indications of the skipper and with an exemplary behavior\ given the situation and the little experience at sea of some of them. After an hour of receiving the attacks\ a large piece of the rudder\ approximately 60 cms.\ came to the surface. One of the orcas began to sniff it and "play" with it for a few minutes to dive in next. We thought that it all ended there\ that when they finally broke the rudder they had achieved their goal and would leave. However\ they continued with the same behavior. At last the salvamar Betelgeuse appeared. They gave a couple of passes with a couple of accelerations and the orcas disappeared. They ask us if we are all okay\ to which I answer in the affirmative\ and if we had steering or needed towing. I start the engine and the boat seems to respond to the helm so we head to La Coruña accompanied by the Salvamar that offers to escort us. After a few minutes and with the Salvamar about 200 meters from us two orcas appear by our stern and hit us again. The Salvamar immediately approaches and they disappear again. The pattern of it is surprised by the intensity of the blow\ which they witness. Without further shocks and escorted very closely by the Salvamar we arrived at the Real Club Náutico de La Coruña\ where we moored on the same day 14 at 19:15.",5 orcas\ dos de 2-3 metros\ una pequeña de 1 metro aproximadamente y una más grande de unos 7 metros\ mordían la pala y empujaban la embarcación por la pala. Hacían burbujas grandes\ golpeaban la superficie del mar con la cola\ y mostraban la parte ventral del cuerpo al sumergirse. 5 orcas\ two of 2-3 meters\ a small one of approximately 1 meter and a larger one of about 7 meters\ bit the rudder blade and pushed the boat by the rudder.

At the beginning\ the orcas started hitting the back (submerged) part of the boat\ basically the rudder\ but then they hit the hull and the keel. Since the orcas didn’t stop\ we called “Salvamento marítimo”\ they advised us to stop boat and engine and so we did. Despite of it the orcas didn’t stop and they even intensified the lunges for another 20 or 25 minutes. The interaction lasted 50 minutes in total. We were able to continue to Vigo\ were the boat is now being repaired. They caused damage to the rudder\ hull and some parts of the rudder gear. The crew were not fishing with a line from the stern.,There were two orcas\ which were not detected before the interaction\ because it was dark.

They then turned off the engine\ removed the mainsail\ and turned off all electronics except the radio. • Apparent damage\ repair required\ ship towed: The ship was towed by the SALVAMAR ALTAIR\ auxiliary of the ship DON INDA to the port of Finisterre\ where on August 9\ it continues to wait to get the ship out of the water and better assess the damage. They broke the rudder blade\ which was left floating in the water near the ship. • Number and behavior of the observed killer whales\ did they detect them before the interaction? They were two killer whales\ which they did not detect before the interaction\ only when they noticed the first blows. They hit the rudder until they broke the shovel and also hit the orza (centreboard). • Was he fishing with a line at the stern? I wasn't fishing,There were two orcas that were not detected before they touched the rudder. They hit the rudder until they broke it and also hit the "orza" (Spanish for centreboard).

Elles sont arrivées nageant rapidement droit sur nous\ ont plongé en arrivant sur nous\ ont touché les coques « virilement » 2 fois chacune \ pas les safrans. Étant à la barre\ j’ai ressenti les chocs comme un déplacement latéral du catamaran. Nous les avons vues repartir vers l’Est\ sans plus.

Nous pensions que si les orques nous prenaient pour des vedettes rapides ou des bateaux de pêche cela serait un atout différenciant. Donc il fallait : - émettre un son puissant\ des vibrations dans l’eau\ - avoir une vitesse suffisante pour faire illusion. - ne pas laisser traîner d’appendices fragiles dans l’eau : hydrogenerateur\ dérives\ pilote connecté … Cela est impressionnant de savoir qu’elles se dirigent vers vous\ Impressionnant de les voir nager si vite et « straight on »\ De voir l’animal de si près\ juste avant les chocs…/// The killer whales came in the same way to hit another friendly catamaran which was sailing 1/4 NM in front of us. We were sailing towards the Canary Islands. Informed by vhf\ we put ourselves in the condition to welcome them with a minimum of expected damage\ according to the conditions described above. They arrived swimming quickly straight at us\ dived on arriving at us\ touched the hulls violently twice each\ not the rudders. Being at the helm\ I felt the shocks as the catamaran moved sideways. We saw them go back east\ nothing more. We had discussed with the other catamaran\ at the port\ about what to do\ just in case... 3 monohulls damaged in Barbate\ having told us about their adventure with the orcas\ we had realised the focus of the orcas on the rudders until total failure\ and the low speed of the sailboats\ none were under motor. We thought that if the killer whales took us for speedboats or fishing boats that would be a differentiating situation. So it was necessary: - emit a powerful sound\ vibrations in the water\ - have sufficient speed to create an illusion. - do not leave fragile appendages lying around in the water: hydrogenerator\ daggerboards\ connected autopilot\ etc. Hence the idea of ​​going at 8 knots\ to satisfy these 3 conditions. It is impressive to know that they are heading towards you\ Impressive to see them swimming so fast and "straight on"\ To see the animal so close\ just before the shocks...,,daytime,waning\7% illuminated\within 3 days of new,Not within 3 days of springs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A vela\ mayor rizada y foque completo. Amurados a babor. De repente sentimos un fuerte golpe\ creemos que en el timón\ y el barco orzó bruscamente en un segundo. pasamos de empopada a un largo cerrado\ aprox 80º viento real y rumbo S\ SE. En palabras del que llevaba el timón\ "un golpe como si hubiésemos encallado". Estabilizamos el barco a un 90º de viento real y continuamos navegando. Al inspeccionar la popa\ vimos la silueta de una orca en nuestra estela\ en la zona del timón. Impactó un pare de veces más con menos violencia que la primera vez. Al momento\ una orca (creemos que macho por la altura de la aleta dorsal\ muy alta y estilizada\ aproximadamente metro\ metro y medio de aleta) se puso a nadar en nuestra aleta de babor a escasamente dos metros\ manteniendo siempre su visión y altura de sus ojos\ a la altura del barco donde estábamos los tripulantes\ alrededor del timón. Otra orca\ creemos que de menor tamaño ya que no salió mucho a la superficie\ se mantenía dando golpes al timón. Golpes fuertes pero no lo suficiente para alterar significativamente nuestro rumbo. Nuestra sensación\ es que la orca grande estaba a una altura de nuestra eslora\ que le permitía vigilarnos a nosotros y el comportamiento de la otra menor. Continuamos navegando\ ya que consideramos que movernos nos otorgaba alguna defensa y no quisimos dejar nuestro barco a merced de las orcas y ellas continuaron golpeando el timón y en alguna ocasión el casco. Apagamos todo\ contactamos con salvamente marítimo de Tarifa\ y continuamos navegando con el timón a un ángulo fijo y llevándolo a mano. Navegábamos ahí a unos 8/9/10 nudos. A los 10 minutos aproximadamente\ o antes\ decidimos echar gasolina por la popa del barco\ y al poco tiempo\ 3/4 minutos dejamos de sentir su presencia. Seguimos navegando rumbo Sur hasta la costa de Marruecos\ donde nos cruzamos con un pesquero de cierto porte que navegaba hacia el W. Nos colocamos en su estela\ muy cerca y salimos del estrecho en la estela del pesquero que por algún motivo nos daba seguridad. Cuando se hubo calmado la cosa\ revisamos la timonería y aparentemente no había ni hay daños\ por lo que proseguimos nuestra navegación hasta Lanzarote (Islas Canarias) sin novedad. Nuestras conclusiones son. Las orcas estaban jugando y controlando en todo momento la situación. No había conducta agresiva\ si ellas se lo proponen nos hubiesen destrozado el barco rápidamente. La de mayor tamaño (6/7/8metros) estaba vigilando y controlándolo todo. Creemos que parar el barco habría sido ponérselo fácil\ y que tuviesen más opciones de morder el timón\ además el viento era muy fuerte y también consideramos que maniobrar ahí con las Orcas debajo no era seguro. Al echar gasolina por la popa se fueron\ pero no sabemos si fue casualidad o que realmente surtió efecto. No pudimos tomar fotos ya que éramos sólo dos tripulantes a bordo y las prioridades eran otras. /// We were sailing out of the narrow SW course with 25/30 knots from the E and against the current of approximately 2 knots. Boat speed between 10/14 knots sailing at an angle of approximately 160º true wind. Under sail\ reefed mainsail and full jib. Port tack. Suddenly we felt a strong blow\ we think on the rudder\ and the boat luffed sharply in a second. We went from downwind to a closed pitch\ approximately 80º real wind and heading S\ SE. In the words of the man at the helm\ "a blow as if we had run aground." We stabilized the boat at a true 90º wind and continued sailing. Inspecting the stern\ we saw the silhouette of an orca in our wake\ in the rudder area. It hit a couple more times with less violence than the first time. At that moment\ an orca (we think it was a male because of the height of the dorsal fin\ very tall and slender\ approximately one meter\ one and a half meters of fin) began to swim on our port fin at barely two meters\ always maintaining its vision and eye level\ at the height of the ship where the crew members were\ around the rudder. Another orca\ we believe that it was smaller in size since it did not come to the surface much\ kept tapping the rudder. Hard hits but not enough to significantly alter our course. Our feeling is that the large killer whale was at a height of our length\ which allowed it to monitor us and the behavior of the other smaller one. We continued sailing\ since we considered that moving gave us some defense and we did not want to leave our boat at the mercy of the killer whales and they continued hitting the rudder and on occasion the hull. We turned off everything\ contacted the maritime salvage company in Tarifa\ and continued sailing with the rudder at a fixed angle and steering it by hand. We were sailing there at about 8/9/10 knots. After about 10 minutes\ or sooner\ we decided to pour gasoline through the stern of the boat\ and after a short time\ 3/4 minutes we stopped feeling its presence. We continued sailing south to the coast of Morocco\ where we came across a fishing boat of a certain size that was sailing towards the W. We placed ourselves in its wake\ very close and left the strait in the wake of the fishing boat that for some reason gave us security. When things had calmed down\ we checked the wheelhouse and apparently there was no damage\ so we continued our navigation to Lanzarote (Canary Islands) without incident. Our conclusions are. The orcas were playing and controlling the situation at all times. There was no aggressive behavior\ if they proposed it they would have destroyed the ship quickly. The largest one (6/7/8 meters) was watching and controlling everything. We believe that stopping the ship would have been easy for them\ and that they would have more options to bite the rudder\ also the wind was very strong and we also considered that maneuvering there with the Orcas below was not safe. When we poured gasoline through the stern they went away\ but we don't know if it was a coincidence or if it really had an effect.,El comportamiento de las orcas era juguetón. Similar al de los delfines en la proa del barco\ pero en la popa. Además la mayor daba la sensación de que estaba vigilando todo. La pequeña golpeaba el timón pero no extremadamente fuerte\ se podía mantener la rueda con las manos y el rumbo. La grande nadaba y saltaba de vez en cuando. En ningún momento sentimos que mordiesen o "agarrásen" el timón. /// The behavior of the killer whales was playful. Similar to that of the dolphins at the bow of the ship\ but at the stern. In addition\ the older one gave the feeling that she was watching everything. The little one hit the rudder but not extremely hard\ you could keep the wheel with your hands and the course. The big one swam and jumped from time to time. At no time did we feel that they bit or "grabbed" the rudder.,daytime,waning\12% illuminated,Not within 3 days of springs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The four killer whales came straight onto the rudder\ there were one or two particularly large killer whales and one small one. The attack lasted at least 15 to 20 minutes\ we did not reverse or lock the helm\ the killer whales went back and forth\ we thought they were leaving but they came back each time. There were three of us on the boat\ we didn't do anything except film the killer whales for insurance. We were told afterwards that we could have dumped diesel into the sea\ apparently this is perhaps a solution (not the most ecological) because they smell of diesel when they come to breathe and do not like it.,Les orques ont directement attaqué le safran. Elles donnaient des coups de tête contre la coque du bateau aussi. A plusieurs reprises\ deux d’entre elles se sont éloignées mais elles revenaient à la charge par l’avant du bateau. On entendait des bruits venant du bois qui se cassait sous les crocs des orques. Au bout d’environ 12 minutes\ elles ont réussi à casser le safran horizontalement (on a perdu la partie basse du safran). Juste après on a vu une des orques « jouer » avec le safran\ elle le poussait avec le bout de son nez. On l’a vue une deuxième fois faire ça et elle a aussi plongé avec le safran.

On ne les a pas revu ensuite./// The killer whales directly attacked the rudder. They were butting against the hull of the boat too. On several occasions\ two of them moved away but they came back to the charge from the front of the boat. You could hear the sounds coming from the wood breaking under the fangs of the orcs. After about 12 minutes\ they managed to break the rudder horizontally (we lost the lower part of the rudder). Right after we saw one of the killer whales "playing" with the rudder\ she was nudging it with the tip of her nose. We saw her a second time doing this and she also dived with the rudder. We couldn't find the rudder. Pretty soon after they removed the rudder\ they were gone. At the beginning\ we saw that they were three to leave then the fourth joined them.

Also we feel at least 2 hard pushes on the keel. we decide to disconnect everything connected to the rudder so it can swing freely from side to side. After about 1 hour we can see they slowly move away and we wait for 30 minutes to be sure they are gone. we can feel we may have some rudder left and we decide to put the spare rudder-arm on\ and set a small sail to control the boat to nearby harbour. as we reach 1.5 knots of speed\ we are attacked again. at this point we call the coastguard. the orcas was still around us pushing the rudder as the coastguard arrive 40 minutes later. at this point we notice the depth sounder was still active and we turn it off. the Spanish coastguard towed us away and the orcas did not follow us. they did not manage to do damage to our rudder because it could swing freely out to the side of the boat and we are unsure if it was the coastguard ship or shutting off the depth sounder that made them leave. looking back we should have been more patient with moving. we still need to have the boat up on land to inspect the damage more clearly as there might be cracks in the fiberglass or hinges. also i dont know if it has been reported\ but a french sailing vessel was towed in 2 hours after us and they was being chased all the way in.,the orcas was spending alot of time observing the rudder and they waited a long time to see if anything moved. it seemed like movement and sound triggered the attacks. they would push it slowly and with force\ but with no succes. then maybe the frustration made them push the boat. Also we think it was playing type of behavior\ since they was first hiding under water with no bubbles or movement under the boat. and second time they let us see them swim far away\ only to circle back under water and wait again\ ready to attack. it seemed like they wanted us to move the rudder or boat so they could keep playing.,daytime,waxing\98% illuminated\within 3 days of full,Not within 3 days of springs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of them disappeared when I felt a light touch on the tiller. I start the reverse gear slowly and suddenly I feel a huge hit again on the tiller when I increase the speed of reverse gear and direct the camera to the stern of the boat in search of the Orca and I see it coming out of the stern of the boat to escape the propeller. Fortunately I have the Video to prove the action taken. I continued in reverse and the group followed in our pursuit for a few minutes until it gave up. If I had turned off the engine I don't know what would have happened...,When I arrived at the place where my colleagues were with the orcas they seemed to be calm as my colleagues had been with them for some time\ always taking care not to have them in their stern. But with my approach despite the distance\ they headed towards our vessel. The initial touch was a small touch so I assumed it was curiosity and it was only because of the violence of the second touch that I decided to carry out the escape with the reverse gear.

We could not see them approaching. Just after the first hit\ we put the autopilot in stand-by\ switched off the engine and also all electronic devices including GPS\ unless the VHF. The main remained hoisted but since there was nearly no wind\ it had no impact in our speed. Our remaining speed was result of the inertia and of the orcas hits.,They were two orcas. The orcas seemed not to pay much attention on us and were focused on the rudder. However during the attack one remained in stand-by and the other hit the rudder. We can not say if they switched the roles in between. After each hit some seconds passed by\ as if they were analysing how to continue and then attacked again.

We did not follow the instructions because we did not know them!! Wish we would have known. We left Marina Coruna but no sign or information there. We first felt a bang to the rudder and then saw the orcas. They were with five. Also small/young one. We were not informed about the orca issue at all. First and last time we read about it was in Dutch press in 2020. Hence we were not prepared and not informed about advised response etc. We continued motoring and did some maneuvering. No effect positive or negative. They stopped when the we stopped moving\ after the broke the rudder rod (see below). The engine was still on and in neutral at that point. We are a family of 5\ three minors and 2 adults and Dutch. We were very scared. We were repairing the main sail at the moment of the attack and no sail up at the moment it happened. Big waves and engine on. We tried to get away from them but could not. There was another sailing boat just behind us but they left them alone. After banging for 15 minutes our rudder got stuck under the hull. They stayed with us for another 15 minutes but the banging became less. Then a rescue boat arrived and helicopter. The orcas came back. Very scary. After 1\5 hours the towboat came. We could not use our rudder as it was stuck and the steering mechanism to the wheel broke in half due to the force.,They were very aggressive. Swimming around and coming from the front to the back and then diving deeper and banging to the rudder! Very frightening. I am not sure if I filled in the right position but I know it was 2 miles northeast of Islas Sisargas. We were drifting towards the island with no working rudder. The orca’s seemed very persistent and push our rudder blade to the left or the right every minute or so for 20 minutes it seemed. If I am correct\ the orcas stopped when the job was done. The rudder rod (between blade and steering wheel) was broken\ the blade got stuck against the hull\ we stopped moving and left the engine running in neutral. They shortly came back when the cruz roja ( Spanish Emergency Services) and the helicopter was at the scene.,daytime,waxing\82% illuminated,Not within 3 days of springs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After ca 3 turns we realized it must be an orca encounter\ so we turned off the autopilot and tried to lock the rudder. They were stronger than the rudder resistance\ so we don't know if it made any difference. They kept on ramming but mostly to one side after that\ pushing the rudder on its maximum angle. At one point they also turned the boat 180 degrees against the wind\ in what felt like one stable\ strong movement. We could see orcas on all sides of the boat\ but decided to stay inside the cockpit cover to keep a low profile. We saw at least a mother and a small child and 3 similar looking orcas. We also rolled in the genoa and kept a reefed mainsail for stability\ with almost no speed in the boat. Turned off the sonar after 5 minutes (as soon as we could think of it). The frequency and intensity of the rammings declined gradually towards the end of the encounter\ which lasted around 15 minutes. We called UK coast guard to inform about the encounter. After checking the rudder with a GoPro we contacted them again to ask for towing to land. There was very little left of our rudder. They suggested to try to manouvre with engine and the little piece of rudder\ and it worked! Slowly and wobbly we managed to get to Brest without assistance.,They made no sound before they started ramming\ so it came as a complete surprise. In the start they focused on ramming the rudder back and forth to the extremes. Sometimes they would swim off\ maybe 10-30 meters from the boat\ and then come back again for more ramming. There was a mother and child who swam in tandem - we did not see them approach the hull/rudder directly\ but it was hard to get a good overview sitting inside the cockpit\ so we cannot exclude the possibility. The orcas blew some air out from time to time after the encounter had started. It seemed like the 3 others went one at a time\ but in the beginning we were hit very frequently\ so they might've gone together aswell. Towards the end there were some breaks of maybe 30-60s between rammings. We saw at least 5 orcas\ but cannot exclude the possibility of there being more.,daytime,waxing\80% illuminated,Not within 3 days of springs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sea state was 3-4m swells and 30-40knot winds and gusts\ so we were uncomfortable to go ‘dead in the water’ with no engines which the Spanish coastguard told us to do. Instead we attempted to outrun the orcas and switch our direction regularly. We also decided to go against ‘protocol’ and bang metal tools against our metal railings and stanchions which seemed to deter them for about 10 minutes. when they returned they carried on trying to get as close to the starboard stern again\ so we started to play loud music on a portable speaker\ banging pots and pans\ and wave black and white striped towels off the stern and after a few minutes they left us alone (during that last interaction the light died out too) so we can’t figure out if our deterrents worked or they got bored of us or the daylight running out made them leave?,The orca that flew over our port bow was quite an aggressive moment\ we couldn’t différenciate between the two that chased but one was very determined in coming as close as it could to the starboard stern\ they regularly came up for air and to maybe see what we were doing? but as soon as we began banging the pots and pans their behaviour seemed like they flinched from the noise and they pulled away.,daytime,waxing\49% illuminated,Not within 3 days of springs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Night was pitchblack (cloudy\ no moon)\ and the weather conditions were not good enough to hear distant blows. Two awake on-duty persons outside\ one awake person inside the sailboat. The three positions (navigation) lights were switched on. Nothing unusual noticeable ; three fishing boats approx 3nm NE from us. Suddenly we felt a strong push going from starboard to port side during several seconds. Boat direction was noticeably modified towards port side\ and was then reset by the autopilot. From the inside of the ship a noise similar to the one that can happen when you accidentally hit a fishing buoy was heard. Then nothing during approx 10 seconds. Then another ~3 sec push\ same kind as the previous one but seemed a bit lighter. Autopilot had some difficulty to cope\ but then worked again. Immediately after\ a blow is heard and two orcas are seen approx 3 meters behind the boat\ slightly on the port side. During the following 10-15 sec\ a few blows are heard\ and at least one orca is seen breathing again heading towards East\ lit by the light of our stern white navigation light\ approx 15 m from our boat. No other sign of the orcas afterwards. We switched on the engine for 20 minutes to leave the area faster and to check if the propeller had been damaged. No answers to our VHF calls. No leaks from the hull or from the rudder area. Then back to sailing ; we progressively hear an loud unusual sound and vibration coming from the rudder area\ in synchronicity with the periodic movement of the boat in the swell. Around 4 am we decide to head East towards shore. During the turning operation we suddenly can't control our direction anymore. Diving with a flashlight\ we see that the rudder is simply not there anymore. During the following hours we build some sort of custom rudder\ using various objects\ and 40nm later we finally manage to reach shore at sunset.

When we arrived at the engines next to him\ 4 killer whales quietly attacked the two rudders of our catamaran. The other sailboat's skipper told us that he no longer had any rudder but no leaks. We immediately stopped the motors and then all the electronics and all the switches on the electrical panel as indicated in the forums. It did absolutely nothing and the killer whales came and ripped off our two rudders. It lasted about 10 minutes despite the cries we made to push them away. We put the genoa back on to get away from the area the killer whales seemed to be protecting. We were powerfully helped by the starboard engine to tack and set sail.,Passage plusieurs fois sous la coque\ tournaient autour du catamaran avec attaque en venant par le côté.

The orcas were not seen before the interaction commenced. The crew initially reversed but then turned off the engine. The crew also poured petrol (or possibly diesel) over the stern but the video shows that this had no effect and the orcas are seen swimming in the area immediately as the fuel was poured. In the first part of the attack approximately 30cm of the lower part of the rudder was removed. Eventually a large Azimut motor yacht assisted by circling the yacht at high speed and this “distracted” the orcas (we assume this statement means that the interaction ended but cannot be certain). The yacht was sailed towards port but required a tow into the marina as the engine sounded very poorly after the interaction.,There were 6 or 7 orcas involved and the crew believed that all acted. The orcas appeared to have no sensitivity to the fuel that was poured overboard.

The boat was stopped with the engine running as the crew had just set the fishing gear. The first they knew of the interaction was when the stern was hit hard. They started to motor away but the hits continued on the side of the boat. They headed towards larger fishing boats to get help. At one point the orcas left and hit another small but newer boat (which wasn’t damaged). However they returned and carried on hitting the sides until they reached larger boats and at that point the orcas went away. The boat was damaged and more water entered the hull than before. The rudder was lifted. Repairs were required and the boat spent two weeks ashore. The crew believed that had they been fully laden the boat would have been capsized.,There were four orcas and they all acted. They hit the stern first and then hit the sides.

I stopped the boat immediately because I had read in a news article about similar incidents that that was the right thing to do. I also turned off the autopilot right away so that the orca wouldn't damage the drive. Then I shut down the engine completely because I thought the noise might bother the orca. I was able to keep navigating\ although the steering quadrant seems to have a lot of play now. I think I might have to replace the upper rudder bushing\ but I won't be able to tell for sure until I haul the boat out of the water in September. The rudder is quite a long lever\ and it's hard to believe that the force of an animal that big on a lever that long would leave no damage whatsoever. But I sailed on for six more days to Corsica with no problems.,This report was obtained by GTOA. It was only one orca that I was aware of.

One orca was seen near a fisherman who was gathering his net. It disappeared but was then seen about 30m away. When it arrived the crew dropped the sails and turned off all electrical systems. Initially they tried to deter it with a boat hook and they shouted at it and switched on one engine but quickly decided to stop that for fear of increasing the aggression. After that they sat still. The protocol cannot be said to have been followed due to the initial reaction. Both rudders were damaged including metal structural elements and the autopilot and one propeller may be damaged. There was concern that water ingress might occur due to the nature and extent of the damage. The boat was towed to port by the maritime rescue service.,There was a single orca. The crew saw it 30m away and it went straight for the rudders before doing anything else. It broke one rudder and then the other on the catamaran. It started to hit the daggerboards but the crew lifted them without damage. The orca then started to hit the hulls with its head\ gathering momentum. The interaction lasted 60 minutes.
